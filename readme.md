# vue-webpack

I found it quite difficult to get a good webpack setup going for vue projects outside of the CLI _(which is great, not knocking it at all!)_ so I decided to spin this up.

The setup includes everything I like to have when starting a new vue project:

-   eslint
-   babel
-   stylelint
-   prettier
-   postcss
-   dev server + hot module reloading
-   production ready builds âœ… - basic vendor splitting + minification
-   CSS reset / normalize
